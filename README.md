# Gaming_SPA

This 3 days exercise had for objective to make us use Webpack and javascript for the first time to create a Single Page Application.
We had to make a website for a fictional video games event using the RAWG Api.

The home page contains the last games released and you can make research by names.
If you click on a video game, you will have more informations about it, like the plot of the story and some screenshots.
